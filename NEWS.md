# rempsyc 0.2.0
* New CRAN submission (incoming)

## rempsyc 0.1.9.6
* Optimize copilot setup workflow part 2: Replace manual `install.packages()` approach with efficient `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2` using pak for better dependency resolution, automatic caching, and targeted package installation. This follows the proven patterns used in other workflows (R-CMD-check, pkgdown) and eliminates redundant manual caching steps (#63)

## rempsyc 0.1.9.5
* Further optimize copilot setup workflow for 50%+ time reduction: Remove redundant system packages (`r-base-dev`, graphics libraries), fix R package caching to target correct directories, remove contradictory suggested package installation step, optimize git checkout to use shallow clone, and streamline testing to essential verification only. Combined with previous optimizations, this achieves significant setup time improvements while maintaining core development functionality

## rempsyc 0.1.9.4
* Optimize custom copilot setup: Remove suggested packages from automated setup to save 3-7 minutes installation time. Suggested packages are now installed on-demand based on specific PR requirements, following targeted installation approach (#51)

## rempsyc 0.1.9.3
* `nice_lm()`: fix bug with factor covariates having more than two levels causing "arguments imply differing number of rows" error (#31)
* `nice_lm_slopes()`: add better error message when factor moderators are used, explaining that only continuous moderators are supported. Also add explicit test documenting that continuous moderators work correctly even when models contain factor covariates with multiple levels

## rempsyc 0.1.9.2
* `nice_scatter`: Major enhancement with two highly requested features:
  * **Point ID display**: New `has.ids` parameter displays point labels/IDs directly on scatter plots using `ggrepel` for intelligent non-overlapping positioning. Use `id.column` to specify a custom column for labels, defaults to row names.
  * **Group-wise correlations**: New `has.group.r` and `has.group.p` parameters display correlation statistics for each group separately with smart anti-overlap positioning. r-values position on left side, p-values on right side to prevent overlap. Includes automatic italic formatting consistent with overall correlation display.
  * Both features integrate seamlessly with all existing plot options and maintain backward compatibility.

## rempsyc 0.1.9.1
* `nice_table`: Fixed cross-environment snapshot test failures by replacing snapshot tests with robust class-based assertions, ensuring consistent behavior across different R environments and platforms.

# rempsyc 0.1.9
* `cormatrix_excel` now relies entirely on `correlation::cormatrix_to_excel()` to reduce maintenance.

## rempsyc 0.1.8.2
* `best_duplicate`: fix a bug with grouped tibbles leading to an error

## rempsyc 0.1.8.1
* `nice_density`: add `vjust = "inward"` and `hjust = "inward"` to annotation to fix changes in `ggpubr`

# rempsyc 0.1.8
* New CRAN submission

## rempsyc 0.1.7.8
* `nice_t_test`: add temporary workaround for paired t-tests failing (#28)

## rempsyc 0.1.7.7
* `nice_table()` gains a new argument: `spacing` (defaults to double space = 2, but can be set to 1 for single spacing)

## rempsyc 0.1.7.6
* `nice_lm()` fix a bug with `nice_lm()` which doesn't work with lm models containing a single term (#27)

## rempsyc 0.1.7.5
* `nice_table()` loses its `nice_table` class because of a name collision with the printing method of the `afex` package for `nice_table` objects (produced with `afex::nice`, #26)

## rempsyc 0.1.7.4
* `plot_means_over_time()`:
  * Now supports more than 5 groups (but shapes are not consistent after that)
  * Gains the `groups.order` argument, like `nice_scatter()`, to organize group factor levels in increasing or decreasing order.

## rempsyc 0.1.7.3
* `plot_means_over_time()`:
  * error bar colours changed from black to group colour to ease the visual distinction of a manual addition of vertical comparison significance bars.
  * New arguments to include significance bars and stars: `significance_bars_x`, `significance_stars`, `significance_stars_x`, `significance_stars_y`

## rempsyc 0.1.7.2
* New function: `grouped_bar_chart()`, to plot categorical data options over several groups.

## rempsyc 0.1.7.1
* New function: `plot_means_over_time()`, to plot group (intervention) data over time (1, 2, 3).

# rempsyc 0.1.7
* CRAN resubmission

## rempsyc 0.1.6.2
* `nice_table`:
  * now converts sigma to its unicode counterpart ("\u03C3")
  * "z" and "Z" are now formatted to two digits instead of zero digits to comply with the Wald Z statistics in SEM (with `lavaan` and `lavaanExtra`)
  * now supports conversion of "CI_lower_B" and "CI_upper_B" columns to "95% CI (b*)".
  * `nice_t_test`: argument warning becomes `verbose` to align with other packages.

## rempsyc 0.1.6.1
* Breaking news: APA 7th edition actually advises against using beta to represent standardized coefficients, but suggests instead to use a lowercase italic b followed by an asterisk: _b_*. `rempsyc` will follow this APA recommendation going forward.

# rempsyc 0.1.6
* CRAN submission

## rempsyc 0.1.5.2
* `nice_varplot`: removed redundant legend

## rempsyc 0.1.5.1
* `nice_slopes` and `nice_mod`:
  * Corrected bug when the `data` argument contained character variables when checking whether variables were standardized.

# rempsyc 0.1.5
* CRAN submission

## rempsyc 0.1.4.1

* `nice_table`: 
  * Now automatically attempts to convert objects (e.g., `emmGrid`) to a dataframe so save users some headache.
  * Now automatically converts column name "t.ratio" to "t".
* `get_dep_version`: various improvements, now more robust

# rempsyc 0.1.4
* CRAN submission

## rempsyc 0.1.3.5
* `nice_table`: fix bug when providing a table of more than one `report::report` object made from Wilcoxon tests.

## rempsyc 0.1.3.4
* `nice_lm_contrasts` and `nice_contrasts`: Code simplified and now supports more than 3 groups, through easystats' `modelbased` package.

## rempsyc 0.1.3.3
* `nice_assumptions`: *p* values from `shapiro.test()` are defined only for vectors of length between 3 and 5000 and was thus throwing an error in these cases. `nice_assumptions` now checks for the sample size and returns `NA` for samples outside this range (#17, @sjewo).

## rempsyc 0.1.3.2
* New functions:
  * `install_if_not_installed`: will only install specified packages if they are not installed. 
  * `get_dep_version`: checks the required version of a specific package dependency by looking at the specified package's DESCRIPTION file directly.
* `best_duplicate`: now supports the `keep.rows` argument, to add a column containing the original rows.
* `overlap_circle`: now support two other scoring methods: "percentage" (1 to 100), and "direct" (must provide the three values from circle 1, overlapping area, and circle 2).

## rempsyc 0.1.3.1
* Added tests for all functions
* Accordingly, updated code to stop using deprecated functions from other packages (`dplyr` and `ggplot2`).

# rempsyc 0.1.3
* CRAN resubmission

## rempsyc 0.1.2.5
* Fixed bug with `check_installed` where required package version were not being specified correctly.
* A way to install all dependencies at once are now provided in the README file.
* Contribution Guidelines are now available.

## rempsyc 0.1.2.4
* `nice_scatter`: `groups.order` now also allows automatic grouping based on value for the response variable (one of the desired levels, "increasing", "decreasing", or "string.length"), for consistency with `nice_violin`.
* `nice_violin`: `order.groups` argument renames to `groups.order` for consistency with `nice_scatter`.

## rempsyc 0.1.2.3
* `nice_scatter`: 
  * fix bug whereas the group legend was lost even when using `has.legend = TRUE`.
  * `has.legend` now defaults to `TRUE` when using the `group` argument.
  * New argument `method`, with choices `"lm"` (default) or `"loess"`.

## rempsyc 0.1.2.2
* `nice_violin`: 
  * For argument `obs`, there are two new choices: `"dotplot"` (same as `obs = TRUE` for backward compatibility) and `"jitter"`, useful when there are a lot of observations.
  * Add new argument `order.groups`, to order the group factor levels based on value of the "response" variable, or on the string lengths for the group names (factor levels). Defaults to "none" to avoid changing previous behaviour.
  * Add new argument `xlabels.angle`, to tilt the labels of the x-axis (useful when working with long string names).

## rempsyc 0.1.2.1
* `nice_table`: Correct beta rounding.

# rempsyc 0.1.2
* CRAN resubmission
* `nice_table`: Readd leading zero for beta.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.9
* `nice_table`: 
  * Now capitalize fit indices for a better integration with package {lavaanExtra}.
  * Simplification of internal coding and column formatting, e.g., columns names close equivalents, such as `"pvalue"` and `"p.value"`, are now automatically converted to `"p"` (similar for others such as `"chisq"` to `"chi2"`, `conf.low` and `CI_low` to `CI_lower`, etc.), for proper formatting.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.8
* `nice_table`: It was requested that the leading zero be omitted for beta values (since it rarely goes beyond 1), so that is now the case (although note that in some edge cases it can go beyond 1, but that may indicate other problems with the model, such as high multicollinearity).

## rempsyc 0.1.1.7
* `format_r`: will now convert NA values to "" instead of "NA"; this is useful when using the `col.format.r` argument in `nice_table` for correlation matrices.
* `nice_table`: CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR now omit the leading zero as they usually cannot be greater than one.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.6
* Fix bug when checking column names (all functions).
* Fix bug in `nice_violin` to accept NULL group argument again (similar to problem corrected in version 0.1.1.4). Also changed the order of argument, with `response` second, and `group` third, since group becomes optional (as consistent with other similar functions).
* Fix a bug in `citation("rempsyc")`.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.5
* `nice_lm` and `nice_lm_slopes`: better error messages if the wrong object type is provided.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.4
* Fix a newly introduced bug whereas `nice_normality`, `nice_density`, and `nice_qq` would not work without a group argument.

## rempsyc 0.1.1.3
* `nice_table` and `format_p`: Now support the logical `stars` argument to add significance stars (defaults to `TRUE` for `nice_table` but `FALSE` for `format_p`).

## rempsyc 0.1.1.2
* `nice_table`: It was pointed out that, in order to align with APA rules regarding tables, the first column should not be centered, but left-aligned. This has been corrected.
* `nice_lm` and `nice_lm_slopes`: Now attempt to automatically detect whether the variables were standardized, and if so, sets `b.label = "B"` automatically.
* `nice_lm`, `nice_lm_slopes`, `nice_mod` and `nice_slopes`: argument `b.label` becomes deprecated in favour of the new `standardize` argument, which defaults to `FALSE` for the first two (as this is most likely the desired result) and `TRUE` for the last two (because models are probably already specified as desired, so we do not want to refit them unless required).

## rempsyc 0.1.1.1
* Now produces clearer error messages when specifying columns that don't exist, across all functions.
* `sr2` function is now removed.

# rempsyc 0.1.1
* CRAN resubmission!

## rempsyc 0.1.0.9
* `nice_assumptions`: now supports list objects, and does not print the interpretation message anymore since it is available from the documentation.
* `nice_var`: now supports list objects.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.8
* `nice_violin` and `nice_contrasts`: Now correctly handle missing values.
* New function! `nice_lm_contrasts`, to handle more complex contrast models involving e.g., interactions between variables (similar to `nice_contrasts`).

## rempsyc 0.1.0.7
* `nice_table`: 
  * `footnote` argument is renamed to simply `note` since this is what it is called in APA table language.
  * Fixed a bug whereas the `note`/`footnote` added an extra empty invisible row at the end.
  * Reduced cyclomatic complexity internally (swapped `if` statements for functions) dramatically (from 85 to 2).
* `nice_contrasts`
  * Default effect size changed to regular Cohen's *d*, and the robust Cohen's *d* (and other effects) can now be specified with the `effect.type` argument.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.6
* Following `easystats`'s policy of minimal reliance on external dependencies, we attempt to once again change a few more packages from hard to soft dependencies: `flextable`, `effectsize`, `performance`, `insight`, and `methods`. So we are left only with the basic blocks for coding: `dplyr` and `rlang`. For `flextable`, this is a breaking change for saving tables, since we now need to specify `flextable::save_as_docx`. However, this change makes sense because (1) we used `flextable` for only one function, (2) some users rely on `rempsyc` for plots and don't use tables, (3) this is consistent with how we are saving `ggplot2` plots already, and (4) it also gives credit to the `flextable` package, as this is the powerhouse that produces the tables under the hood.
* `nice_violin` now provides more informative error messages if the response or group variables are misspelled.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.5
* `nice_lm`, `nice_mod`, `nice_lm_slopes`, and `nice_slopes` now use "two.sided" as alternative for the sr2 effect size confidence interval, to facilitate interpretation and in accordance with current norms in psychology.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.4
* Since `easystats` added a new function to calculate the sr2, `effectsize::r2_semipartial`, `rempsyc` now relies on that function. First, it has the advantage of also providing a confidence interval for the sr2. Second, it also fixes a bug when using factors in `lm` models that was introduced when switching from `car::Anova` to manual calculation via the formula interface.
* Accordingly, `rempsyc::sr2` becomes deprecated and will be removed completely in the next major version, please use `effectsize::r2_semipartial`.
* `nice_mod` and `nice_lm_slopes` now use `nice_lm` internally to reduce code redundancy and shorten the code base (and `nice_slopes` uses `nice_lm_slopes` internally).
* To align with other package dependencies, `rempsyc` now requires `R >= 3.6`
* `nice_reverse` loses its `warning` parameter, as the warning seems unnecessary (and annoying to some), given all relevant information is available from the documentation.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.3
* `nice_table` now only keeps the first occurrence of repeated (duplicated) dependent variables, and merges (and centers). Only works for a column called "Dependent Variables". For columns named "Predictor" and "Term", now also converts colons ":" to the multiplication symbol, "×".
* `outliers_plot` changes name to `plot_outliers`, to be consistent with the verb naming approach.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.2
* `nice_varplot` and `nice_var`: Now ignores missing values when calculating variance.

## rempsyc 0.1.0.1
* New function to visualize outliers: `outliers_plot`, which generates a violin scatter plot (dot plot) and adds lines for +/- 3 MAD (or SD, based on selected method). Importantly, supports plotting by group.
* `nice_violin`: at some point in time, it supported a single group (or no group), but this feature was lost at some point. It is now back.

# rempsyc 0.1.0
* CRAN resubmission!

## rempsyc 0.0.9.9
* `nice_contrasts`: corrects a bug whereas the effect sizes appeared in the wrong order.

## rempsyc 0.0.9.8
* `nice_violin` gets some love after receiving its first citation (Jensen & Westergaard, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12525; yeah!!). It now defaults to *not* using bootstrapping per default, so it now needs to be requested explicitly. The bootstrapping method (BCa) is now specified in the documentation, and it is also clarified that the bootstrapping only applies to the confidence interval (not e.g., the mean). Underlying code is also simplified. Finally, a bug is fixed whereas the function used bootstrapping even when `boot` was set to `FALSE`.

## rempsyc 0.0.9.7
* We move `ggplot2` from a hard (imported) dependency to a soft (suggested) one, since many people seem to be using `nice_table` over the plotting features. And given the recent `isoband` CRAN dependency events.

## rempsyc 0.0.9.6
* We get rid of `car_Anova` and `lmsupport_modeleffectsizes` and now compute the sr2 ourselves! With the help of our friends `insight` and `performance`.

## rempsyc 0.0.9.5
* `rempsyc` gets lighter, as we get rid of the rather large `car` package dependency (by incorporating the single function we were using, `Anova`), and move other packages (`boot`, `lmtest`, `ggrepel`, `ggsignif`, and `qqplotr`) from required to suggested packages.

## rempsyc 0.0.9.4
* `nice_table`: automatic formatting (of p-values, confidence intervals, etc.) now supports more than two levels of headers (with the `separate.header` argument).

## rempsyc 0.0.9.3
* Now that `openxlsx2` is on CRAN, `cormatrix_excel2` replaces `cormatrix_excel` (and `rempsyc` package does not rely on an external GitHub dependency anymore, yeah!).

## rempsyc 0.0.9.2
* `nice_table`: Multilevel headings, with the `separate.header` argument, now supports automatic formatting (of p-values, confidence intervals, etc.).

## rempsyc 0.0.9.1
* `nice_table`: 
    * fixed sr2 incorrectly showing leading zero.
    * new argument: `col.format.ci`, to format confidence intervals (accepts lists of lower and upper thresholds)
* `find_mad` and `nice_assumptions`: fixed printing method

# rempsyc 0.0.9
* CRAN resubmission!

## rempsyc 0.0.8.2
* `nice_var`: now returns a dataframe instead of a tibble
* Updated docs: all functions now have `value`/`return` fields describing the function's output.
* `cormatrix_excel` and `cormatrix_excel2`: now require an explicit file name, as per CRAN policies.

## rempsyc 0.0.8.1
* New function: `extract_duplicates`, to extract all duplicates (including first one) for closer inspection
* New function: `best_duplicate`, to keep only the best duplicate based on the number of missing values
* nice_na: `all_na` output column now also counts non-numeric variables

# rempsyc 0.0.8
* CRAN resubmission!

# rempsyc 0.0.7
* First CRAN submission!
* This requires bumping the package version to 2 decimals only.

## rempsyc 0.0.6.6
* Preparing for CRAN submission.

## rempsyc 0.0.6.5
* `nice_normality`: `breaks.auto` argument now uses `na.rm = TRUE` to support missing values

## rempsyc 0.0.6.4
* `nice_normality`: `breaks.auto` argument added to allow control of the density plot in this aspect.

## rempsyc 0.0.6.3
* `nice_density`: Switch back to not using the Sturges method per default.
* `nice_table`: Internal change to stay compatible with new `flextable` version

## rempsyc 0.0.6.2
* `nice_density`: Now uses `na.rm = TRUE` internally to support data with missing values.

## rempsyc 0.0.6.1
* `find_mad`: New argument `mad.scores` to return robust zscore (MAD) scores instead of raw scores (now default to TRUE).

# rempsyc 0.0.6
* `nice_density`: Now uses the Sturges method to define the optimal number of bins automatically. Also adds two new arguments: `breaks.auto = TRUE`, if one does not want to use the Sturges method, and `bins = 30`, to define bins manually, if needed.

## rempsyc 0.0.5.9
* `cormatrix_excel2`: Added a third (sixth) colour for one star significances (* = p < .05), and add an argument for printing the correlation matrix to the console too (or not), `print.mat`.

## rempsyc 0.0.5.8
* `nice_table`: Added `chi2` automatic formatting (+ `chi2.df` formatting)

## rempsyc 0.0.5.7
* `nice_na`: integrated a feature request to include the number of rows that were all NAs.

## rempsyc 0.0.5.6
* New function: `cormatrix_excel2`: a new version of `cormatrix_excel` relying on the `openxlsx2` package and that allows incorporating significance stars along the correlation matrix, as well as a second sheet containing the matrix of p-values. Experimental until `openxlsx2` reaches CRAN.

## rempsyc 0.0.5.5
* Fixed `nice_randomize` as it had been outputting the wrong output format for within-subject designs when moving from plyr to dplyr (+ updated runsheet tutorial).
* `nice_table`: changed back from `layout = "fixed"` to `layout = "autofit"` now that `flextable` fixed the unnecessary line breaks for confidence intervals

## rempsyc 0.0.5.4
* `cormatrix_excel`: corrected values for small, medium, large correlations (from 0.0-0.3: small; 0.3-0.6: medium; 0.6-1.0: large to 0.0-0.2: small; 0.2-0.4: medium; 0.4-1.0: large).

## rempsyc 0.0.5.3
* Corrected spelling of all code with `devtools::spell_check()`
* Restyled all code according to the tidyverse guidelines with `styler::style_pkg()`
* `nice_table`: greatly improved APA title feature thanks to @Buedenbender (and shout-out to his package [datscience](https://buedenbender.github.io/datscience/) and function [flex_table1](https://buedenbender.github.io/datscience/reference/format_flextable.html) on which this improvement was based!)

## rempsyc 0.0.5.2
* `nice_table`: added new argument, `separate.header`, a logical (and simplified) form of the `flextable::separate_header` argument.

## rempsyc 0.0.5.1
* New package site, hooray!
* `cormatrix_excel`: 
    * Changed default method of base `cor` function from "na.or.complete" to the most liberal one to match SPSS: "pairwise.complete.obs".
    * Added a `use` argument to specify which one to use in case a user wants a different option.
* `nice_table`:
    * Automatized integration with the `report` package so we don't have to specify the e.g. `report = "lm"` argument manually.
    * Added optional arguments for table title and footnote.
* Many functions (based on `goodpractice` package recommendations): 
    * Changed `sapply` for `lapply` since `sapply` is not recommended and using `vapply` with list outputs was too complicated.
    * Shortened line codes to < 80 characters.
    * Replaced 1:length(...) or 1:nrow(...) by seq_along(...).

# rempsyc 0.0.5
* `nice_na`: added scales argument to specify specific scales

## rempsyc 0.0.4.9
* New function: `nice_NA`; nicely reports NA values according to existing guidelines. This function reports both absolute and percentage values of specified column lists.

## rempsyc 0.0.4.8
* `nice_density` and `nice_normality`: added the possibility to provide no group argument so as to have a plot of all data.

## rempsyc 0.0.4.7
* `nice_violin`: made default contour lines thicker, but also added argument `border.size` to allow customization.

## rempsyc 0.0.4.6
* `nice_violin`: Corrected a bug whereas the Cohen's *d* wasn't added to the plot if manual annotation (as opposed to automatic) comparisons were made. Also, the default test used in `geom_signif::geom_signif()` was the Wilcox test. It has been changed to the t-test to avoid confusion when results mismatch. Finally, the contour lines were made thicker since at high resolution they appeared too thin.
* New function: `format_d` to format d values as e.g., `0.30` instead of `0.3` e.g., on violin plots.

## rempsyc 0.0.4.5
* `nice_violin`: Added the ability to add the Cohen's d to the plot

## rempsyc 0.0.4.4
* `find_mad`: improved reporting of ID and row number

## rempsyc 0.0.4.3
* `nice_table`: changed default table width (again)

## rempsyc 0.0.4.2
* `nice_table`: changed default table width

## rempsyc 0.0.4.1
* `find_mad`: corrected a bug whereas having a dataframe with no outliers in certain situations generated an error

# rempsyc 0.0.4
* `nice_density` and `nice_normality`: added the `histogram` option to add an histogram to the density plot.

## rempsyc 0.0.3.9
* Created an internal ggplot2 APA "theme" to avoid code redundancy across plots

## rempsyc 0.0.3.8
* `nice_table`: greatly improved underlying code: more clarity (dplyr) and less repetition (with added internal functions)

## rempsyc 0.0.3.7
* `nice_violin`: reverted theme to original default (alpha = 1 and black border) from modified theme some time ago (alpha = .70, white border). Users wishing to keep the original style can simply specify these options in their script.

## rempsyc 0.0.3.6
* New function: `nice_contrasts` for planned contrasts (multiple group pairwise comparisons)

## rempsyc 0.0.3.5
* `nice_t_test`: Fixed `mu` value for one-sample t-test

## rempsyc 0.0.3.4
* Added `ggplot2::waiver` to reexports
* Added table of content to readme

## rempsyc 0.0.3.3
* `find_mad`: Now only prints individual variables that do have outliers. However, it now lists all variables checked at the top to avoid possible confusion.
* Also reformatted arguments vertically instead of horizontally within functions for clarity (doesn't affect users or documentation proper).

## rempsyc 0.0.3.2
* `nice_t_test`: Added support for one-sample t-test.

## rempsyc 0.0.3.1
* new functions for the median absolute deviation (MAD): `find_mad` to find outliers based on the MAD, `scale_mad` to scale (standardize) data based on the MAD, and winsorize_mad to winsorize (bring outliers in +/3 SD) based on the MAD.

# rempsyc 0.0.3
* `nice_table`: brought a correction to the automatic 95% CI so that when numbers are rounded to 0, the zeros still show (e.g., 0.20 instead of 0.2).

## rempsyc 0.0.2.9
* `nice_normality`: improved implementation of the `title` argument
* `nice_table`: added *N* as italic in header

## rempsyc 0.0.2.8
* `nice_table` 
    * integration with `broom` package: moved columns Method and Alternative to beginning for consistency with treatment of the `report` package.
    * Fixed appropriate decimals display for degrees of freedom with actual decimals (e.g., for Welch t-test).
* `nice_t_test`: Added optional Bonferroni correction argument (and other corrections if possible). Other corrections to be implemented in the future.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.7
* `nice_t_test`: changed from package `effsize` to `effectsize` for effect size because the Cohen's d value for paired samples wasn't consistent with other packages.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.6
* Integration with `report` package: combined CI_low and CI_high for method `t.test` (just like for method `lm`)
* Added an optional `short` argument to get a more concise table output from the `report` package integration

## rempsyc 0.0.2.5
* Fixed a slight model number mix-up in `nice_slopes`.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.4
* Added support for paired t-tests (only adaptation of Cohen's d was necessary) and updated documentation to give multiple examples of t-test customization.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.3
* Added warning to `nice_t_test` informing users about the Welch t-test being used per default (through base R `t.test`'s default) and how to change it. Also added option to turn off this warning.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.2
* new function: `nice_lm` to format any existing `lm` model object in a proper format for `nice_table`, including sr2
* new function: `nice_lm_slopes` to format simple slopes for any existing `lm` model object in a proper format for `nice_table`, including sr2
* `nice_mod` and `nice_slopes`: 
    * Added model number when more then one model.
    * Also added an optional `mod.id = TRUE` argument, to display the model number, when there is more than one model.
    * Also reordered default order of rows when there is a second moderator present as it makes more sense to group the same models completely together for different levels of the second moderator.
    * By combining the row names within the list object rather than in the combined dataframe, we also don't have to worry about changing names, etc. anymore. Thus it is now cleaner and not missing with variable names.

## rempsyc 0.0.2.1
* `nice_mod` and `nice_slopes`: Added an argument `b.label` to rename b, e.g., to capital B if using standardized data for it to be converted to the Greek beta symbol automatically in the `nice_table` function.

# rempsyc 0.0.2
* nice_mod and nice_slopes: Corrected a bug whereas having column names with periods would cut off the variable names before the dots because of the automatic correction of the interaction term row names which contain periods as well.

## rempsyc 0.0.1.9
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Improved `report` package integration with `nice_table`
 
## rempsyc 0.0.1.8
* Moved some packages to suggest with `rlang::check_installed`. Make the package lighter.
* Added compatibility of `nice_table` with the `report` package

## rempsyc 0.0.1.7
* `nice_table`: changed argument name `dataframe` for `data` for consistency.

## rempsyc 0.0.1.6
* Added compatibility of `nice_table` with the broom package
* `nice_randomize`: sorted 'within' group by id (as it should have always been)
* Realized that trying to have tidy selection and not having to quote arguments creates problems for vectorization. So we are back to quoted arguments on `nice_scatter` and `nice_varplot`.
* Integrated `format_p` internally in the other functions
* `nice_scatter` and `nice_varplot`: now allow to directly provide the group argument without having to convert to factor manually. Also allow to remove line to just keep points.
* Added jitter to `varplot` function

## rempsyc 0.0.1.5
* Added criteria argument to `nice_var` to specify the desired threshold. Also moved data argument first for pipe compatibility.
* Significant overhaul to functions, such as changes of argument names order.

## rempsyc 0.0.1.4
* new function: `nice_normality`

## rempsyc 0.0.1.3
* added new function: `format_values`
* Added new function: `cormatrix_excel`
* Fixed the `geom_smooth() using formula 'y ~ x'" warning in nice_scatter()` error
* removed row names from `nice_t_test`
* added width argument to `nice_table`

## rempsyc 0.0.1.2
* removed dependency on `plyr`

## rempsyc 0.0.1.1
* added new function: `nice_reverse()`

# rempsyc 0.0.1
* integrated `rcompanion::groupwiseMean` internally with documentation
* removed `lmSupport_modelEffectSizes` from exports to use as internal function only
* removed `crayon` package dependency
