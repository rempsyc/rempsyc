\usage{
nice_t_test(
  data,
  response,
  group = NULL,
  correction = "none",
  paired = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame.}

\item{response}{The dependent variable.}

\item{group}{The group for the comparison.}

\item{correction}{What correction for multiple comparison
to apply, if any. Default is "none" and the only other option
(for now) is "bonferroni".}

\item{paired}{Whether to use a paired t-test.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to display the Welch test warning or not.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to the \code{\link[=t.test]{t.test()}}
function (e.g., to use Student instead of Welch test, to
change from two-tail to one-tail, or to do a paired-sample
t-test instead of independent samples).}
}
\value{
A formatted dataframe of the specified model, with DV, degrees of
freedom, t-value, p-value, the effect size, Cohen's d, and its
95\% confidence interval lower and upper bounds.
}
\description{
Easily compute t-test analyses, with effect sizes,
and format in publication-ready format. The 95\% confidence interval
is for the effect size, Cohen's d, both provided by the \code{effectsize} package.
}
\details{
This function relies on the base R \code{\link[=t.test]{t.test()}} function, which
uses the Welch t-test per default (see why here:
\url{https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2015/01/always-use-welchs-t-test-instead-of.html}).
To use the Student t-test, simply add the following
argument: \code{var.equal = TRUE}.

Note that for paired \emph{t} tests, you need to use \code{paired = TRUE}, and
you also need data in "long" format rather than wide format (like for
the \code{ToothGrowth} data set). In this case, the \code{group} argument refers
to the participant ID for example, so the same group/participant is
measured several times, and thus has several rows. Note also that R >= 4.4.0
has stopped supporting the \code{paired} argument for the formula method used
internally here.

For the \emph{easystats} equivalent, use: \code{\link[report:report]{report::report()}} on the
\code{\link[=t.test]{t.test()}} object.
